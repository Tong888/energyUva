This project wants to show the work I've done during my Master's internship in Amsterdam. The focus of this work was finding outliers in the gas consumption of some buildings.

The results are described in this [page](http://www.marcodena.it/blog/detecting-anomalies-with-neural-newtorks/).

NOTE: the pylearn2 version is based on [this mod](https://github.com/denadai2/pylearn2/tree/LMLS3) that added a cost function. (Check the branch or ask me)
